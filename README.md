# Covid-19-Discord-Bot

Coronavirus is a very serious threat, and hundreds of people are dying each day due to
the virus. We want you to stay home as much as possible to stay healthy, but that doesnâ€™t mean
that you should be bored! We created a bot that can suggest possible fun social activities,
depending on how many friends you can hang out with on Discord.

The features of the COVID-19 Discord Bot:

Quarantine encourger: 

The bot will check the content of the messages in chat with a list for words commonly used when people are 
talking about meeting together like meet or general locations like bar. If it sees a word on the list, it will 
encourge people to stay home and if ask them to use ~case for COVID data in thier area if detectfakenews is on.
It will also choose a random activity from a list of prerecorded actives for the group to do instead. 

Hanh Wash Reminder:

The bot will keep track of the last time a user posted in the chat
and if there is a four hour difference between the posts, the bot will remainder the user to wash their hands to fight this pandemic

COVID-Case Tracker: 

The tracker show data about COVID from a database updated by John Hopkins University
by typing in ~case [state], [county] .
The bot will show the date of the latest update, confirmed cases of COVID, and the death caused by COVID

Fake News Detector:

By typing ~detectfakenews, the detector can be turn on/off for the server and the bot will say who disable/enabled the detector
with the detector on, the bot will check the messages for labled myths, deletes the original message, 
and it reposts the message labeled as fake news for the chat to see.
